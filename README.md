# React Native Version Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development: errors arising from version mismatches between your project and its dependencies.  Specifically, it showcases a scenario where a third-party library expects a specific React Native version, but the project uses a different one.

## Problem

The `RNVersionMismatch.js` file contains code that attempts to use a library with strict React Native version requirements.  If your project's React Native version doesn't match, you'll encounter errors.  These might range from subtle runtime issues to build failures.

## Solution

The `RNVersionMismatchSolution.js` file shows how to resolve the problem.  The primary strategy is carefully managing dependencies using package managers (like npm or yarn).  This involves ensuring that all libraries are compatible with your target React Native version.
