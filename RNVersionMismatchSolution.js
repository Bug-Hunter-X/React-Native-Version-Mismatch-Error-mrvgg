The solution involves using package.json to specify exact versions of dependencies or using version ranges that are compatible.  Update the version requirements for your third party library to work with your current React Native version.

Here's an example of a `package.json` that explicitly specifies versions:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native": "0.71.8",
    "some-third-party-library": "^1.2.3"
  }
}
```

If you are using yarn, using resolutions to override versions might be a solution

```json
{
  "resolutions": {
    "some-third-party-library": "^1.2.3"
  }
}
```
Alternatively, consider updating your React Native version to be compatible with the third-party library, if feasible.  Always check the library's documentation for compatibility information.
